`**Hello!** Thanks for adding <@719933714423087135> to your server! This bot's main feature is randomizing Civilization V picks 
Randomizer gives each player a set of civs to pick from (similar to DotA's single draft) 
If you enable bans players can also **ban** civs, removing them from random pool 
**DLCs** can also be disabled if someone doesn't have some or you just want to play Vanilla game 
After everyone got their civs they can vote to reroll. If 70%+ of players has voted all player will get a new set to pick from.

**Bot's default prefix** is \`!\`, but you can change it using \`prefix\` command.
**If your server has a bot with  \`!ban\` command you should change the prefix to avoid actually banning someone** 
There also are some standard commands like \`ping\` or \`roll\`
To view full command list you can use \`help\` or visit bot's github page

While you were reading this bot (probably) has already set up a \`#civilizator\` channel and \`Civilized\` role
-Randomizer-related commands are bound to your \`#civilizator\` channel and are ignored in other ones. 
-You need to have a \`Civilized\` role (or be server admin) to \`start\` a game.
 Also by default this channel is only visible to users with \`Civilized\` role. You can change it in channels settings
-All members of your server can get the role with \`getrole\` command
 You can enable/disable this command with \`getrole+\`/\`getrole-\` 
 You can change bound channel using \`lockchannel\` command in a channel you want to set bond to. 
Channel or role names can be changed as you wish. If you accidentally delete them you can recreate them using \`createrole\` and \`createchannel\`.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions you can visit bot's Discord server
Also you can DM the bot to submit 

Now try starting a game with \`start 3 1\`
