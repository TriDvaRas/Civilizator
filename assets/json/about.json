Basicaly all players receive a random and unique selection of 1-6 civilizations to choose from.\nCurrently supported games: Civ5, Civ5+LEK, Civ6.  \nIf you enable bans players can also **ban** civs, removing them from the pool \n**DLCs** can also be disabled if someone doesn't have some ~~or in case you want to feel the Vanilla experience~~ \nAfter everyone receives their civs they can vote to reroll. If 70% (can be changed) of players has voted all player will receive a new set to pick from."
